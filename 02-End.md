# SSH keys

## Further reading
- [Guide for Cryptographic Keys](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15r7pVxQuR2NSJw_CV4uCXhbqZQOpJa1muxvBN8gWRI0/edit) (in Norwegian)
- [man ssh-keygen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen) has good information. In _very_ short:
    - -t gives the type of key to generate
    - -b gives the length of the key. Longer is more secure
    - Higher -a makes the key more difficult to brute-force-attack
    - -C gives a comment. Good comments are important for good key management!
